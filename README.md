## Test Cases

### First Factorial
Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed
and return the factorial of it (e.g. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)).
For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will
always be an integer.


### Reverse String
Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and
return the string in reversed order. For example: if the input string is
"Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string
"sredoC dna dlroW olleH".


### Longest Word
Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and
return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that
are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length.
Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.

### Capitalize Letter
Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and
return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that
are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length.
Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.
